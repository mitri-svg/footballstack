    <p>Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer,[a] is a team sport played between two teams of
        11 players each, who primarily use their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field called a pitch. The
        objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into
        a rectangular-framed goal defended by the opposing team. Traditionally, the game has been played over two
        45-minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes. With an estimated 250 million players active in over 200
        countries and territories, it is the world's most popular sport.

        The game of association football is played in accordance with the Laws of the Game, a set of rules that has been
        in effect since 1863 and maintained by the IFAB since 1886. The game is played with a football that is 68–70 cm
        (27–28 in) in circumference. The two teams compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts
        and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. When the ball is in play, the players mainly use their feet, but may
        use any other part of their body, except for their hands or arms, to control, strike, or pass the ball. Only the
        goalkeepers may use their hands and arms, and only then within the penalty area. The team that has scored more
        goals at the end of the game is the winner. Depending on the format of the competition, an equal number of goals
        scored may result in a draw being declared, or the game goes into extra time or a penalty
        shootout.[5]Internationally, association football is governed by FIFA. Under FIFA, there are six continental
        confederations: AFC, CAF, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, OFC and UEFA. National associations (e.g. The FA or JFA) are
        responsible for managing the game in their own countries both professionally and at an amateur level, and
        coordinating competitions in accordance with the Laws of the Game. The most senior and prestigious international
        competitions are the FIFA World Cup and the FIFA Women's World Cup. The men's World Cup is the most-viewed
        sporting event in the world, surpassing the Olympic Games.[6] The two most prestigious competitions in European
        club football are the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Women's Champions League, which attract an extensive
        television audience throughout the world. Since 2009, the final of the men's tournament has been the
        most-watched annual sporting event in the world.[7]</p>
    <h3>Neymar</h3>
    <ul id="neyma">
        <li>Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior (born 5 February 1992), known as Neymar Júnior or mononymously as
            Neymar, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain
            and the Brazil national team. The most expensive player ever, he is a prolific goalscorer and renowned
            playmaker widely regarded as one of the best players in the world and one of the greatest Brazilian players
            of all time.[3][4][5] Neymar has scored at least 100 goals for three different clubs, making him one of four
            players to achieve this feat.[6] <div class="img10 img"></div>

            Neymar came into prominence at Santos, where he made his professional debut aged 17. Soon becoming the
            Brazilian's league star player, he won the 2011 Copa Libertadores, being Santos' first since 1963. He was
            named the South American Footballer of the Year in 2011 and 2012, and relocated to Europe to join Barcelona
            in 2013. In his second season, as part of Barcelona's attacking trio with Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez,
            dubbed MSN, he won the continental treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League.
            Motivated to be the focal player at club level, Neymar unexpectedly transferred to PSG in 2017[7] for €222
            million.[note 1] In his debut season, he excelled in French football, winning the league title and being
            voted Ligue 1 Player of the Year.[10] Despite recurring injuries in Paris, he helped PSG attain an historic
            domestic quadruple in the 2019–20 season, and was integral to PSG reaching its first ever Champions League
            final, being named in the UEFA Team of the Year for the second time in his career.Debuting for Brazil aged
            18, Neymar is currently joint-top goalscorer for his national team alongside Pelé, with 77 goals in 124
            matches. He won the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, winning the Golden Ball. His participation in the 2014
            FIFA World Cup and 2015 Copa América was cut short by injury and a suspension, respectively, before
            captaining Brazil to their first Olympic gold medal in men's football at the 2016 Summer Olympics, having
            already achieving a silver medal at the 2012 edition. Having renounced the captaincy, he featured at the
            2018 World Cup, and after missing the 2019 Copa América through injury, helped Brazil to a runner-up finish
            at the 2021 tournament.

            Neymar finished third for the FIFA Ballon d'Or in 2015 and 2017, has been awarded the FIFA Puskás Award, has
            been named in the FIFA FIFPro World11 twice, and the UEFA Champions League Squad of the Season three times.
            Off the pitch, he ranks among the world's most prominent sportsmen. SportsPro named him the most marketable
            athlete in the world in 2012 and 2013, and ESPN cited him as the world's fourth-most-famous athlete in 2016.
            In 2017, Time included him in its annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world.[11] In 2018,
            France Football ranked Neymar the world's third-highest-paid footballer. The following year, Forbes ranked
            him the world's third-highest-paid athlete,[12] dropping a spot to fourth in 2020.[13]</li>

    <h3>Messi</h3>
    <ul id="messi">
        <li>Lionel Andrés Messi[note 1] (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi] (listen); born 24 June 1987),
            also known as Leo Messi, is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains
            both Major League Soccer club Inter Miami and the Argentina national team.
            Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record seven Ballon d'Or
            awards[note 2] and a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 he was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream
            Team. Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he
            won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and the UEFA
            Champions League four times.[note 3] With his country, he won the 2021 Copa América and the 2022 FIFA World
            Cup. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La Liga (474),
            most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (eight), and most assists in La Liga (192) and
            the Copa América (17).<div class="img1 img"></div> He also has the most international goals by a South
            American male (103). Messi has
            scored over 800 senior career goals for club and country, and has the most goals by a player for a single
            club (672).Messi relocated to Spain from Argentina aged 13 to join Barcelona, for whom he made his
            competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within
            the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first
            treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Three successful seasons
            followed, with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the first player to win the award
            four times. During the 2011–12 season, he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a
            single season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons,
            Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before
            regaining his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading
            Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed
            captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and won a record sixth Ballon d'Or in 2019. Out of contract, he signed for
            French club Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, spending two seasons at the club and winning Ligue 1 twice.
            Messi joined American club Inter Miami in July 2023.

            An Argentine international, Messi is the country's all-time leading goalscorer and also holds the national
            record for appearances. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing the
            tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics.
            His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with his compatriot Diego Maradona,
            who described Messi as his successor. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest
            Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup (2006), and reached the final of the 2007 Copa América,
            where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina
            to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, the 2015 Copa
            América, winning the Golden Ball, and the 2016 Copa América. After announcing his international retirement
            in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a
            third-place finish at the 2019 Copa América, and victory in the 2021 Copa América, while winning the Golden
            Ball and Golden Boot for the latter. For this achievement, Messi received a record-extending seventh Ballon
            d'Or in 2021. In 2022, he led Argentina to win the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where he won a record second Golden
            Ball, scored seven goals including two in the final, and broke the record for most games played at the World
            Cup (26).</li>

    <h3 class="imj ">Cristiano Ronaldo</h3>
    <ul id="ronaldo">
        <li>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM (Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaldu]; born 5
            February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Saudi
            Professional League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest
            players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards[note 3] and four European Golden Shoes, the
            most by a European player. He has won 32 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA
            Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for
            most appearances (183), goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals in the European
            Championship (14), international goals (123) and international appearances (200). He is one of the few
            players to have made over 1,100 professional career appearances, and has scored over 800 official senior
            career goals for club and country, making him the highest goalscorer of all time.<div class="ronal img">
            </div>

            Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning the
            FA Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the
            Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the
            subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a
            transfer worth €94 million (£80 million). He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with
            Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale which was integral to the team winning four Champions League wins from 2014 to
            2018, including La Décima. During this period, he won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again
            in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also
            became the club's all-time top goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, and finished
            as the competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Real, Ronaldo won
            four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, three UEFA Super Cups and three Club World
            Cups. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the most
            expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two
            Supercoppa Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player and
            became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned
            to Manchester United in 2021, finishing his only full season as the club's top scorer, before his contract
            was terminated in 2022. In 2023, he signed for Al Nassr.

            Ronaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has since earned 200 caps,
            making him Portugal's most-capped player. With more than 100 goals at international level, he is also the
            all-time top goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in and scored at eleven major tournaments; he scored his first
            international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed captaincy of the
            national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the
            Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at
            Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement
            would see him receive his fourth Ballon d'Or. He also led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations
            League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals, and later received the Golden Boot as top
            scorer of Euro 2020.

    <h3 class="imj">Ronaldo Nazário</h3>
    <ul id="nazario">
        <li>Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima (Brazilian Portuguese: [ʁoˈnawdu ˈlwiz nɐˈzaɾju dʒi ˈlimɐ]; born 18 September
            1976),[2] known as Ronaldo or Ronaldo Nazário, is a Brazilian business owner and president of Segunda
            Division club Real Valladolid, owner of Brasileiro Série A club Cruzeiro, and a former professional
            footballer who played as a striker. <div class="nazar img"></div>Nicknamed O Fenômeno ('The Phenomenon') and
            R9, he is considered as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport. As a multi-functional
            striker who brought a new dimension to the position, Ronaldo has been an influence for a generation of
            strikers that have followed. His individual accolades include being named FIFA World Player of the Year
            three times and winning two Ballon d'Or awards.

            Ronaldo started his career at Cruzeiro and moved to PSV in 1994. He joined Barcelona in 1996 for a then
            world record transfer fee and at 20 years old, he was named the 1996 FIFA World Player of the Year, making
            him the youngest recipient of the award. In 1997, Inter Milan broke the world record fee to sign Ronaldo,
            making him the first player since Diego Maradona to break the world transfer record twice. At 21, he
            received the 1997 Ballon d'Or and remains the youngest recipient of the award. By the age of 23, Ronaldo had
            scored over 200 goals for club and country. However, after a series of knee injuries and recuperation, he
            was inactive for almost three years. Ronaldo joined Real Madrid in 2002 and won the 2002–03 La Liga title.
            He had spells at AC Milan and Corinthians before retiring in 2011, having suffered further injuries.

            Ronaldo played for Brazil in 98 matches, scoring 62 goals and is the third-highest goalscorer for his
            national team. At age 17, he was the youngest member of the Brazilian squad that won the 1994 FIFA World
            Cup. At the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Ronaldo received the Golden Ball as the player of the tournament after he
            helped Brazil reach the final, where he suffered a convulsive fit hours before kick-off. He won the 2002
            FIFA World Cup, starring in a front three with Ronaldinho and Rivaldo. He scored twice in the final and
            received the Golden Boot as the tournament's top goalscorer. At the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Ronaldo scored his
            15th World Cup goal, a tournament record at the time. He also won the 1997 Copa América, where he became the
            player of the tournament and the 1999 Copa América, where he was the top goalscorer.</li>

    <h3 class="imj">Karim Benzema</h3>
    <ul id="benzema">
        <li>Karim Mostafa Benzema (born 19 December 1987) is a French professional footballer who plays as a striker for
            Saudi Professional League club Al-Ittihad. Regarded as one of the best strikers of all time, he is a
            creative forward renowned for his goal-scoring ability, as well as his technical skills, vision, and
            versatility on the field.[4][5][6] He is Real Madrid's all-time second-highest goalscorer and top assist
            provider.[7] Benzema won 24 trophies with Real Madrid, including four La Liga, three Copa del Rey, and five
            UEFA Champions League titles.<div class="img benze"></div>

            Born in Lyon to Algerian parents, Benzema began his career with hometown club Olympique Lyonnais in 2005,
            contributing sporadically to three Ligue 1 title wins. In 2008, he was named the league's Player of the Year
            and in the Team of the Year having finished as the league's top goalscorer and winning his fourth league
            title and first Coupe de France. In 2009, Benzema was the subject of a then-French record football transfer
            when he joined Real Madrid in a deal worth €35 million. After struggling to establish himself in his debut
            season, he eventually achieved a consistent goalscoring rate with the club, notably being part of a highly
            rated trio alongside Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale — dubbed BBC — who were integral to four Champions
            League wins from 2014 to 2018. 

            Following Ronaldo's departure in 2018, Benzema transitioned from the false 9 position into a sole striker.
            He was named in the La Liga Team of the Season for four consecutive years from 2018 to 2022, won La Liga
            Best Player twice and the Pichichi Trophy for the first time in 2022. Benzema finished as Champions League
            top scorer as he won his fifth title in 2022, and subsequently captained the club in his final season before
            signing for Al-Ittihad the following year.

            A French international, Benzema won the 2004 UEFA European Under-17 Championship and made his senior debut
            for France in 2007, at age 19. He earned 97 caps, including scoring in three and appearing in four major
            tournaments, and ranks as France's sixth-highest all-time top goalscorer. Benzema was controversially left
            out of the squad for the 2010 World Cup and did not play for France for over five years after being
            implicated in a blackmailing scandal in 2015; he later returned to the squad before announcing his
            international retirement in December 2022. He has been named French Player of the Year by France Football
            four times. For his performances in 2021 and 2022, Benzema was awarded the UEFA Player of the Year and the
            Ballon d'Or, becoming the fifth French player to have won the Ballon d'Or.[8] At 34 years and 302 days old,
            he is the second-oldest winner of the award, after Stanley Matthews.[9]</li>

    <h3 class="imj">Luis Suárez</h3>
    <ul id="suarez">
        <li>Luis Alberto Suárez Díaz (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈlwis ˈswaɾes]; born 24 January 1987) is a Uruguayan professional footballer who plays as a striker for Campeonato Brasileiro Série A club Grêmio and the Uruguay national team. Nicknamed El Pistolero ('The Gunman'), known for his finishing inside and outside the box, comfort on the ball heading ability and passing, Suárez is regarded as one of the best players of his generation and one of the greatest strikers of all time.[2] Suárez has won two European Golden Shoes, an Eredivisie Golden Boot, a Premier League Golden Boot, and a Pichichi Trophy. He has scored over 500 career goals for club and country.[3] <div class="suar img"></div>

            Suárez began his senior club career at Nacional in 2005. At age 19, he signed for Groningen, before transferring to Ajax in 2007. There, he won the KNVB Cup and the Eredivisie. In 2011, Suárez signed for Premier League club Liverpool, and won the League Cup in his first full season. Having established a strike partnership with Daniel Sturridge, he equalled the goalscoring record for a 38-game Premier League season and won his first European Golden Shoe in 2014. That summer, Suárez moved to Barcelona in a transfer worth £64.98 million (€82.3 million), making him one of the most expensive players of all time.
            
            Dubbed MSN, Suárez was part of a dominant trio alongside Lionel Messi and Neymar, winning the treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League in his first season. In his second season, he won the Pichichi Trophy and his second European Golden Shoe, becoming the first player since 2009 to win both awards other than Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo.[4] He also led La Liga in assists, becoming the first player to do so in both goals and assists in league history.[5][6] With Barcelona, Suárez won ten additional trophies, including three La Liga titles and three Copas del Rey. He signed for Atlético Madrid in 2020, winning his fifth La Liga title in his debut season.[7]
            
            At international level, Suárez is both Uruguay's all-time leading goalscorer, as well as the all-time top scorer of FIFA World Cup qualifiers in CONMEBOL.[8] He has represented his nation at four editions of the FIFA World Cup and four editions of the Copa América, as well as the 2012 Summer Olympics and the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. He was named in the 2010 World Cup All-Star Team and won the 2011 Copa América, where he was awarded Best Player. Outside of his football credentials, Suárez has been a source of controversy throughout his career,[note 1] including a goal-line handball against Ghana at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, biting opponents on three occasions,[note 2] accusations of diving,[16][17] and racial incidents.</li>

    <h3 id="ronaldinho">Ronaldinho</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ronaldo de Assis Moreira (born 21 March 1980), commonly known as Ronaldinho Gaúcho (Brazilian Portuguese: [ʁonawˈdʒĩɲu ɡaˈuʃu]) or simply Ronaldinho,[note 1] is a Brazilian retired professional footballer who played mostly as an attacking midfielder, but was also deployed as a winger. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, he won two FIFA World Player of the Year awards and a Ballon d'Or. He is the only player ever to have won a World Cup, a Copa América, a Confederations Cup, a Champions League, a Copa Libertadores and a Ballon d'Or.[4] A global icon of the sport, Ronaldinho was renowned for his technical skills, creativity, dribbling ability and accuracy from free-kicks, his use of tricks, feints, no-look passes and overhead kicks, as well as his ability to score and create goals, all prominent characteristics of his early-age background playing futsal. He is known by the nickname "O Bruxo" ("The Wizard").[5][6] <div class="ronaldin img"></div>

            Ronaldinho made his career debut for Grêmio, in 1998. At age 20, he moved to Paris Saint-Germain in France before signing for Barcelona in 2003. In his second season with Barcelona, he won his first FIFA World Player of the Year award as Barcelona won the 2004–05 La Liga title. The season that followed is considered one of the best in his career as he was integral in Barcelona winning the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League, their first in fourteen years, and another La Liga title, giving Ronaldinho his first career double, receiving the 2005 Ballon d'Or and his second FIFA World Player of the Year in the process. After scoring two spectacular solo goals in the first 2005–06 El Clásico, Ronaldinho became the second Barcelona player, after Diego Maradona in 1983, to receive a standing ovation from Real Madrid fans at the Santiago Bernabéu.
            
            Following a second-place La Liga finish to Real Madrid in the 2006–07 season and an injury-plagued 2007–08 season, Ronaldinho suffered a decline in his performances—often put down to a decrease in dedication and focus having achieved so much in the sport—and departed Barcelona to join AC Milan, where he won the 2010–11 Serie A. He returned to Brazil to play for Flamengo in 2011 and Atlético Mineiro a year later where he won the 2013 Copa Libertadores, before moving to Mexico to play for Querétaro and then back to Brazil to play for Fluminense in 2015. Ronaldinho accumulated numerous other individual awards in his career: he was included in the UEFA Team of the Year and the FIFA World XI three times each, and was named UEFA Club Footballer of the Year for the 2005–06 season and South American Footballer of the Year in 2013; in 2004, he was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players.
            
            In his international career with Brazil, Ronaldinho earned 97 caps and scored 33 goals and represented his country in two FIFA World Cups. After debuting with the Seleção by winning the 1999 Copa América, he was an integral part of the 2002 FIFA World Cup-winning team, starring alongside Ronaldo and Rivaldo in an attacking trio, and was named in the FIFA World Cup All-Star Team. As captain, he led his team to the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup title and was named man of the match in the final. He also captained the Brazil Olympic team to a bronze medal in men's football at the 2008 Summer Olympics.</li>

    <h3>Roberto Carlos</h3>
    <ul id="carlos">
        <li>Roberto Carlos da Silva Rocha (born 10 April 1973), often known as Roberto Carlos and sometimes as RC3[note 1] is a Brazilian former professional footballer who currently works as a football ambassador.[4] He started his career in Brazil as a forward but spent most of his career as a left-back and has been described as the "most offensive-minded left-back in the history of the game".[5] A free kick specialist throughout his career, his bending shots have measured at over 105 miles per hour (169 km/h).[6][7] In 1997, he was runner-up in the FIFA World Player of the Year. Widely considered one of the greatest full-backs in history, in 2004 he was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players.[8][9][10] <div class="carlos img"></div>

            At club level, Roberto Carlos joined Real Madrid from Inter Milan in 1996 to spend 11 highly successful seasons, playing 584 matches in all competitions and scoring 71 goals. At Real, he won four La Liga titles and the UEFA Champions League three times. In April 2013, Marca named him in their "Best Foreign Eleven in Real Madrid's History".[11] He is one of the few players to have made over 1,100 professional career appearances at club and international level.
            
            Roberto Carlos made his debut for the Brazil national team in 1992. He played in three World Cups, helping the team reach the final in 1998 in France, and win the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan. He was named in the FIFA World Cup All-Star Team in 1998 and 2002. With Brazil he is especially known for a bending 40-yard free kick against France in the inaugural match of Tournoi de France 1997. With 125 caps he has made the third-most appearances for his national team.[12] He was chosen on the FIFA World Cup Dream Team in a 2002 FIFA poll.
            
            He took up management and was named as the manager of Sivasspor in the Turkish Süper Lig in June 2013.[13] He resigned as head coach in December 2014.[14] From January to June 2015, he was manager of Akhisarspor. Although Roberto Carlos announced his retirement from playing at the age of 39 in 2012,[15] in July 2015 he was appointed player/manager of Indian Super League club Delhi Dynamos, with whom he would make three appearances.[16]
            Roberto Carlos began his professional career playing for União São João, a football club based in Araras in the state of São Paulo. In 1992, despite playing at what was seen as a lesser club and only being 19 years old, he was called up for the Brazil national team. In August 1992, aged 19, he joined Atlético Mineiro on loan and went on the club's tour of Europe.[18][19][20] The tour consisted of the B team, as the club was prioritising the first Copa CONMEBOL in South America at the same time. The tour served as a test for many players, and those who stood out could be integrated definitively to the main group. Roberto Carlos did not participate in the first two games in Italy but played the full match against Lleida in Spain on 27 August in a match for the Ciutat de Lleida Trophy. He remained in the team for the next two games, held in Logroño, against Logroñés and Athletic Bilbao. Before retiring from football in 2014, Roberto Carlos thanked Atlético Mineiro for the opportunity.[17]</li>
